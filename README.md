Bankist App is a mini money management app. Users can keep track of their transaction history and balance with dates and times using Bankist.

You can explore the application, do some transactions, take a fake loan and more, using these username passwords:

- Username: as | Password: 1234
- Username: rr | Password: 1111

_This app is not connected to any database and was made to practice developing frontend for web applications using Vanilla JS._
_Although, [here](https://github.com/asaxena012/Tasker-TodoApp) is one of my projects that uses firebase as backend._
